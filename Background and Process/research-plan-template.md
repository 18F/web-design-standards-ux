## Opening script (EDIT BASED ON PROJECT)

My name is [your name] and I'm working with <CLIENT> on making improvements to the naturalization application.

We were hoping to grab between 30 and 45 minutes of your time to get your feedback on <FOCUS OF RESEARCH>. If you have the time, we’d like to ask you to complete an activity that will show us where these improvements are working and where they are failing.  

Your participation in this activity is completely voluntary, and we will not ask for more than 45 minutes of your time. If at any time you'd like to end our session, that is your right and we will gladly wrap things up.

Are you interested in participating?

**YES or NO checkpoint**

* If **Yes** - Continue
* If **No** - Thank them for their time and excuse yourself.

Thank you again for agreeing to participate. I will be moderating this session and you will notice others joining the session, as well. They are observing the session and taking notes to ensure we don’t miss anything.

With your permission, we will be audio taping these sessions. The information that is captured will only be used for evaluation, research and training purposes and will not be shared outside of the project team. Is it OK for me to begin recording now?

We will take the following precautions to keep your responses anonymous:

* We will **not** write your name on our interview notes
* We will **not** label our recordings of our interview with your name.
* We keep the list of people we interviewed, our notes, and the recording in a secure place where only team members can access it.
* We will **not** ask for, or collection, any information that easily identifies you.

This consent form summarizes this information. [Hand over consent form.]

At the bottom, you can choose whether we may share quotes from your interview. Unless you give us permission, we will not share any quotes from your interview (even anonymized ones) outside our project team. If you’re open to us sharing quotes in reports to our project team or in blog posts that describe our project, check the box below the signature lines.

Take a few minutes to read over the consent form and sign the consent form. Feel free to ask me any questions that come up!

Do you have any questions for me before you get started? You can also ask questions at any point during the interview.
